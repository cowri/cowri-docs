# Internet Money and Stablecoins

Collectively, stablecoins represent a powerful new monetary system. A system open to all on the internet, transparent and peer-to-peer. But, individually, a stablecoin cannot constitute Internet Money. If we can unify disparate stablecoins into a coherent monetary system, then we can create a stable and liquid medium of exchange, i.e. money.

## Stablecoin fragmentation

The problem with stablecoins is that they are highly fragmented - there are five major stablecoins in circulation along with hundreds of minor currencies. Stablecoin fragmentation is bad for end-users, developers and decentralized finance \(DeFi\) protocols. For end-users, dealing with the complexity of transacting with many different stablecoin will be prohibitively difficult. Imagine keeping track of dozens if not hundreds of different stablecoins in your wallet, just to make simple payments? Developers have an even harder challenge since they will have to manage the complexity of stablecoin payments across their entire platform.

The DeFi ecosystem is a network of protocols each building on top of the other. Stablecoins are the primary means of settlement within and between protocols. Fragmentation in the stablecoin market will increase settlement costs in DeFi. Fragmentation also increases the systemic risk posed by a broken stablecoin peg.

## The Cowri Shell Protocol

To address the needs of end-users, the protocol creates a seamless and intuitive user experience when transacting with multiple stablecoins. The user need not manage individual balances. The sender and receiver need not even agree on which stablecoins to use. See our [demo](https://demo.cowri.io) and our [user tutorial.](https://github.com/cowri/cowri-docs/tree/15d1de0017dfa6830e600658ddff4bdaba45524a/insert%20url%20here/README.md) For developers, Cowri has an SDK that makes integration between Cowri and your project simple and easy. Check out our [developer guide](https://github.com/cowri/cowri-docs/tree/15d1de0017dfa6830e600658ddff4bdaba45524a/insert%20url%20here/README.md) and [tutorial.](https://github.com/cowri/cowri-docs/tree/15d1de0017dfa6830e600658ddff4bdaba45524a/insert%20url%20here/README.md)

For DeFi, we are building a liquidity pool optimized for stablecoin-to-stablecoin trades. This liquidity pool is designed to be highly capital efficient, exists entirely on-chain and allows liquidity providers to select which tokens they want exposure to. To learn more about the liquidity pool and how it fits into the broader Cowri Shell Protocol, see our [architecture ](https://github.com/cowri/cowri-docs/tree/15d1de0017dfa6830e600658ddff4bdaba45524a/insert%20url/README.md)documentation.
