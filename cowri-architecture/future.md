## Overview

**TBD - Kenny - your input here**
Cowri has created a protocol that allows stablecoins to interoperate, the Cowri shell protocol. With our decentralized protocol, users can hold and transact any number of different stablecoins as if they were using a single currency. The Cowri shell protocol can even accommodate users if they prefer completely different currencies. In effect, our platform creates internet money without issuing or holding any tokens or financial assets.
