# Introduction

Cowri's goal is to create Internet Money by building a stable and liquid medium of exchange accessible to anyone. The Cowri Shell Protocol accomplishes this by unifying stablecoins into a coherent monetary system. The protocol does not take custody of users' assets and does not rely on issuing any tokens.

### Navigation

**Users:** with Cowri, transacting with multiple stablecoins is as easy as using a single currency. We built this [**demo**](https://demo.cowri.io) to showcase what the protocol can do. Read this [**tutorial**](cowri-user-guide/1-user-tutorial.md) for instructions.

**Developers: i**f you are a developer and want to integrate Cowri into your project, see the [**developer guide.**](cowri-developer-guide/developerguide.md) ****
