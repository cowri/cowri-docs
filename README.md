### Cowri Introduction

The goal of this project is to create Internet Money by building a stable and liquid medium of exchange accessible to anyone. This medium of exchange will be a decentralized protocol that unifies stablecoins (i.e. cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset, usually USD) into a coherent monetary system. The Cowri Shell Protocol will not issue any tokens of its own and does not take custody of users' assets. 

The problem with stablecoins is that they are highly fragmented - there are five major stablecoins in circulation along with hundreds of minor currencies. This fragmentation creates problems is three areas:

   (1) Bad end-user experience
   (2) Prohibitively complicated for developers to integrate stablecoins into their projects
   (3) Exacerbates fragility of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols

Imagine buying coffee and having to first argue with the shop over which of the two hundred stablecoins to use? Managing even a handful of different stablecoin balances will be prohibitive for users.
