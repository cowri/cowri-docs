# Cowri Introduction

The goal of this project is to create Internet Money by building a stable and liquid medium of exchange accessible to anyone. The building blocks of Cowri's medium of exchange are stablecoins, cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset such as the US dollar. Individually, a stablecoin is limited. But if they work in unison, they become quite powerful. The Cowri Shell Protocol unifies an arbitrary number of stablecoins into a coherent monetary system. This is analogous to how nation states developed central banks to unify their fragmented banking system, except Cowri takes a decentralized, bottom-up approach. Cowri lets users interact with multiple stablecoins as if they were using a single currency. This is accomplished not by issuing any new tokens, nor by holding custody of user assets. Instead, the Cowri Shell Protocol is based on a set of logical procedures that ensure users always receive stablecoins they are willing to accept. Users of the protocol need not agree on which stablecoins to hold; heterogeneous preferences are accommodated.
