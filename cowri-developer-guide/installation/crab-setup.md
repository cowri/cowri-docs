# Crab Setup

## Setting up the development environment

There are a few technical requirements before we start. Please install the following:

* [Node.js v8+ LTS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) \(comes with Node\)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Once we have those installed, we only need one command to install Truffle:

```text
npm install -g truffle
```

To verify that Truffle is installed properly, type `truffle --version` on a terminal. If you see an error, make sure that your npm modules are added to your path.

We also will be using \[Ganache-CLI\]\([https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli)\), a personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests. You can download Ganache-CLI with \`npm install -g ganache-cli\`

 **Note**: You can also use Truffle Develop, Truffle's built-in personal blockchain, instead of Ganache-cli. You will need to change some settings---such as the port the blockchain runs on---to adapt the tutorial for Truffle Develop.
